'All' will simply give back all the entries collected. This should mostly be
used for testing.

>>> let monitor = generate :: Monitor All
>>> result (notifyMany monitor [1.0,2.0,3.0]) :: [Double]
[1.0,2.0,3.0]

The following property should hold:

prop> result (notifyMany (generate :: Monitor All) xs) == xs

  type S All = [Double]
  collect _ = flip (:)

instance Default All where
  initial _ = []

instance Resultable All [Double] where
  r _ = reverse

instance Resultable All String where
  r _ [] = "Collected: (none)"
  r _ xs = "Collected: " ++ intercalate ", " (show <$> xs)

{-|
'Max' will result in the largest entry collected so far. If no entry was
collected so far, results in 'Nothing'. If any entry was collected, results
in 'Just' the maximum.

>>> let monitor = generate :: Monitor Max
>>> result (notifyMany monitor [1.0,2.0,3.0]) :: Maybe Double
Just 3.0
>>> result (notifyMany monitor []) :: Maybe Double
Nothing

The following property should hold:

  r _  xs = maybe naught (\x -> "Max: " ++ show x) res
    where
      naught = "No maximum found"
      res = r (Proxy :: Proxy Max) xs :: Maybe Double

{-|
'Min' will result in the largest entry collected so far. If no entry was
collected so far, results in 'Nothing'. If any entry was collected, results
in 'Just' the maximum.

'Every' will feed another metric every @n@th element collected. 'Every' will
feed the metric the first, @n+1@ th, @2n+1@ th, ... collected elements.

'Last' will feed another metric the last @n@ elements collected.

'PeriodOf' will feed another metric with chunks of @n@ elements. 'result'
returns the list of the results (one for each chunk).
